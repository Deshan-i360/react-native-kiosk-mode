# React Native Kiosk Mode demo App

Hi! This is a simple demo project to show how to build a basic app in Kiosk Mode.


Run `npm install`

Also, you might wanna play with the lines 

```
throw new RuntimeException("Boom!");
return true;
```

To test the auto reboot in case of crash, or delete the whole section SO YOU CAN LEAVE THE APP.
